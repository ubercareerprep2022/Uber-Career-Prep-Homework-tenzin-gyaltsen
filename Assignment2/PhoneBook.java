 * Interface for a phone book.
 * Each entry in the phone book is made up of 2 components: a name (String) and
 * a phone number (long).
 * For the purposes of this exercise, you can assume that there are no duplicate
 * names.
 *
 * For example, assume we have a phone book with the following data:
 *
 * {"name": "ABC", "phoneNumber": 1111111111}
 * {"name": "XYZ", "phoneNumber": 9999999999}
 * {"name": "DEF", "phoneNumber": 2222222222}
 *
 * then,
 * the size() method should return 3,
 * find("ABC") should return 1111111111,
 * find("XYZ") should return 9999999999,
 * find("PQR") should return -1.
